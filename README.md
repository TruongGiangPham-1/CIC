### install
1. create a python virtual environment and activate it
2. git clone the repository
3. `cd CIC/`
4. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5. `cd GridWorldEnv/`
6. `pip3 install -e .` to install the gridowrld package

right now I am just working locally on GridWorldEnv/GridWorldEnv/ens/grid_world.py. Therefore, I am just running `python3 GridWorldEnv/GridWorldEnv/ens/grid_world.py` to test gridworld features
